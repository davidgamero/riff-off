Face off against your friends as you compete to sing at least 4 bars of randomized songs in this team-based battle of music knowledge!

Choose your settings and then Riff Off will do the rest - providing you with randomized lyrics from the [Top Songs of All Time](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Mf614QiAuop5ud9x5beBS) on Spotify. Then it's a race against time to see if your team can come up with a song containing the lyric.

## How it works

Riff Off relies on the [Spotify API](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/#getting-started) to gather lyrics into a word bank that it pulls from throughout the game. When the timer runs out, whichever team was left hanging forfeits their point to the opposing team and the fun starts all over again. And don't worry about having to deal with annoying word repeats - Riff Off saves recently played words to local storage so the challenge never dies, even across multiple games!

## How to play

### Select your settings

Riff Off offers 3 settings:
1. Difficulty - how rare or common the words are
2. Duration - how much time teams have to come up with a song
3. Goal - how many wins each team needs to claim a victor

### Start singing!

If your button is highlighted, it's your turn to sing! Your team has to come up with a song that contains the word in the center of the timer before the timer runs out. If you do, hit the button to start the other team's turn. If you don't, that's the opposing teams point.

See your points rack up in your button so you never lose track. And don't worry - if you decide you need more time, a larger victory goal or easier words, you can always click on the settings icon to change your game the way _you_ want to play it.
